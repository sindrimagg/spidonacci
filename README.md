The idea behind this project comes from this video [One second to compute the largest Fibonacci number I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzT9I1d-LlQ), but I wanted to do it in Rust.
This program compares the following 5 methods:

## NaÃ¯ve implementation
Where the Fibonacci numbers are calculated using the recurrence $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
## Matrix exponentiation
Matrix exponentiation, using *binary exponentiation* and the fact that:
```math
\begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\F_{n} & F_{n-1}\end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}^n,
```

for all $n\geq 0$. We can exploit that the matrices are symmetric and only use have to calculate the upper triangular part (or the lower triangular part).

## Strassen like matrix exponentiation
Matrix multiplication that uses only 4 multiplications instead of 5 as in the other part at the cost of having to do 6 additions compared to 3.

## Closed form formula
This method uses the Binet formula for the Fibonacci numbers:
```math
F_n =\frac{\varphi^n -\psi^n}{\varphi-\psi}= \frac{(1+\sqrt{5})^n-(1-\sqrt{5})^n}{2^n\sqrt{5}},
```
where $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}$ is the golden ratio and $\psi = 1- \varphi$. Now we can compute this efficiently using the fact that if 
```math
(a+b\sqrt 5)^n = c + d\sqrt{5}
```
 then 
 ```math
 (a-b\sqrt 5)^n = c - d \sqrt{5}
 ```
where $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb Z$. This means that:
```math
F_n =\frac{2d \sqrt 5}{2^n \sqrt 5} = \frac{d }{2^{n-1}}.
```
And we calculate it using, again, *binary exponentiation*. We actually have a little weird multiplication to deal with the power of 2 in the denominator. Thus let $(a,b) := a + b \sqrt 5$ and we define multiplication to be $(a,b)*(c,d)=((ac+bd 5)/2, (ad + bc)/2)$, and the multiplicative identity is $(2,0)$. The $n$-th Fibonacci number is then the second term of $(1,1)^n$ where $(1,1)^0 = (2,0)$ and $(1,1)^n = (1,1)^{n-1} * (1,1)$, if $n > 0$.

## Fast squaring
Lastly we will use fast squaring which is based on:
```math
\begin{pmatrix}F_{2n+1} & F_{2n} \\F_{2n} & F_{2n-1}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}^{2n}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}^n\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}^n=\begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\F_{n} & F_{n-1}\end{pmatrix}^2
```
```math
=\begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1}^2+F_n^2& F_n(F_{n+1}+F_{n-1}) \\F_n(F_{n+1}+F_{n-1}) & F_n^2 + F_{n-1}^2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1}^2+F_n^2& F_n(2F_{n+1}-F_n) \\F_n(2F_{n+1}-F_n) & F_n^2 + F_{n-1}^2\end{pmatrix}.
```

## TODO
Currently this uses the BigInt Crate, and I would want to use my own big integer library.
